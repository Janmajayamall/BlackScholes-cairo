# BlackScholes-Cairo

This repository contains implementation of BlackScholes in Cairo and uses [Lyra protocol's implementation](https://github.com/lyra-finance/lyra-protocol/blob/master/contracts/BlackScholes.sol) as a reference.

That means all values are 27 digit fixed point numbers and most functions use formulas outlined in the solidity file.
